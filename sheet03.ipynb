    "In this exercise sheet we will start to work on a real dataset from an ongoing experiment. In this experiment the participants were asked to freely explore an unknown virtual city, called Seahaven, with an interactive map. After a sufficiently long exploration the participants were tested on three different tasks: \n",

    "- the **absolute orientation** of a single house towards the north cardinal direction\n",
    "- the **relative orientation** between two houses \n",
